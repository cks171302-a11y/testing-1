Overview
As part of the “Green@Community Recycling Network Analysis” team, I evaluated the cost-effectiveness of Green@Community to inform resource allocation. Reflecting on my experience drafting a government enquiry for GCAP 3226, I realized how much I underestimated the complexity of formal communication. Writing to a government agency required not just clarity, but also precision and respect for protocol—qualities. I had to consciously develop. The process made me appreciate the importance of framing questions in a way that is both specific and considerate of privacy boundaries. I learned that even a well-crafted request can be denied, which challenged my assumptions about data accessibility and forced me to think creatively about alternative sources.

AI assistance was both a guide and a mirror. It helped me structure my letter professionally, suggesting phrasing and organization I might not have considered. At the same time, it made me reflect on my own communication habits—was I being clear enough, or too informal? This collaboration with AI sharpened my awareness of tone and audience, skills that are essential for professional growth.

The exercise also deepened my understanding of the barriers to government data access. I saw firsthand how these limitations shape the scope of participatory policy analysis. Ultimately, I realized that while data access is crucial, adaptability and resourcefulness—using proxy data and observation—are just as important for meaningful policy recommendations.
